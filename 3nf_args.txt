I have been asked to bring forth arguments as to why my datamodel complies with the third normal form. The broad definition of
3NF is that the model 1) does not have transitive dependency and 2) complies with the first and second normal form as well.
In other words, the facts should be organized inside the datamodel in a way that minimizes reduncancy, facilitates and simplifies
future changes to the tables, and actually represent the entities themselves.
Some business rules in regards to what the model should contain did exist, and I have extracted the identifiable entities along
with their attributes and built the model around it so it complies with all the other requirements as well.
